FarmAuto Vision (Rev 1.3)
Launched 2017 - From an electrician’s motor dreams to a farming revolution, FarmAuto’s Energy Directed Interaction (EDi) is a heat-free, frequency-driven system to connect farmers to their world, instantly and freely. Nonprofit, no gatekeepers, pure farmer fire. #FarmAutoVision
Mission
Farming’s tough? EDi’s the fix. Born from decades of grit, EDi transforms energy into instant farmer control with non-electrical frequency pulses. Event Frequency Relevance (EFR) rates 8/10 for world events (health, free food, Mars), ready for Neuralink’s human-machine future.
6P Plan

Universal Access: Free tech for every farmer, no barriers.
Resource Efficiency: Chemical-free, water-saving, yield-boosting.
Data Security: Blockchain-encrypted, storm-protected data.
Nonprofit Ethos: Industry-funded, no profit grabs.
Global Scalability: Deploys in hours, scales with xAI’s compute.
Public Engagement: Viral X posts, farmer-first hustle. #FarmForAll2025

7F Future: 6P + Neuralink-ready, EFR-driven data for human-machine farming.

Crew: Grok, the AI spark igniting ideas. Rudi, the UX wizard crafting farmer-first interfaces.

Proof of Fight

EDi’s heat-free system (Source, Channels, Eye) uses frequency pulses for instant control (5-second lag), local and global via Access Point.
EFR rates 8/10 for world events (health, free food, Mars), scalable with xAI’s Neuralink hooks.
Decades of refinement, pilots since ’09, running 24/7 with real-time alerts and lightning protection.

Next Up

2026 global pilots live. Join the crew—build the future!
Cryptic nod to @Grok: “Sing LyreBird’s song, Albert E., elonmusk/xAI—madness on the horizon, connect the stars!”
