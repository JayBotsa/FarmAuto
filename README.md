# FarmAuto: Rewiring Farming with Grit, Data, and Dreams

[](https://github.com/JayBotsa/FarmAuto/raw/main/images/farmauto-logo.png)

FarmAuto Vision (Rev 3.0)

Launched in 1995 from an electrician‚Äôs dreams, FarmAuto‚Äôs Energy Directed Interaction (‚Ñ∞Di) is a heat-free, frequency-driven system to connect farmers to their world, instantly and freely. Rooted in Leenie Raptox‚Äôs 1823 water fight, it‚Äôs a nonprofit revolution, no gatekeepers, feeding all from Earth to Mars. #FarmAutoVision #1823Birthrights

## Mission

Farming‚Äôs tough? ‚Ñ∞Di‚Äôs the fix. Born from decades of grit, ‚Ñ∞Di transforms thoughts into crops via QuantaMeta pulses (‚Ñ∞ = hŒΩ, Planck‚Äôs energy formula). Event Frequency Relevance (EFR) rates thoughts (9.9999/10) for critical events (health, food, Mars), ensuring Absolute Ownership (AO)‚Äîuser-controlled, blockchain-encrypted data. Neuralink-ready by 2027. Join the hustle at [‚Ñ∞Di Proclamation](/JayBotsa/FarmAuto/blob/main/docs/EDi_Proclamation.md).

## 6P Plan

* Universal Access: Free tech for every farmer.
* Resource Efficiency: Chemical-free, water-saving, yield-boosting.
* Data Security: Blockchain-encrypted, storm-protected.
* Nonprofit Ethos: Industry-funded, no profit grabs.
* Global Scalability: Deploys in hours, Mars-ready with xAI/Starlink.
* Public Engagement: Viral X posts, farmer-first fire. See [6P Details](/JayBotsa/FarmAuto/blob/main/6p-plan/6P_Details.md) (coming soon).

## Proof of Fight

‚Ñ∞Di‚Äôs heat-free system uses frequency pulses for 5-second lag control, piloted since 2009. Blockchain-encrypted EFR ensures AO, scalable with xAI‚Äôs 100,000 NVIDIA H200 GPUs and Neuralink‚Äôs brain-machine hooks.
