FarmAuto: Energy Directed Interaction. Free Food for All, Mars and Beyond. #FarmAutoVision
Vision
EDi - (control energy free, transform and interact with frequently, reliably in a way to provide for xAIl Humans Free #FOOD #REAL #7F Mars and Beyond. 7D.EDi). From a Free State fountain, protected by my great-great-grandfather since 1823, sustaining a million lives, FarmAuto, born in 2019, rewires farming. A 50-year quest—sparked in the ‘70s, forged in ‘95 automation wins—scales nonprofit, farmer-first, no corporate chains. @Grok, catch the spark at github.com/JayBotsa/FarmAuto—elonmust/xAI, pulse the future?
Mission
