FarmAuto Vision

EDi - (control energy free, transform and interact with frequently, reliably in a way to provide for xAIl Humans Free #FOOD #REAL #7F Mars and Beyond. 7D.EDi). 

From a Free State fountain, protected by my great-great-grandfather since 1823, sustaining a million lives, FarmAuto, born in 2019, rewires farming. A 50-year quest—sparked in the ‘70s, forged in ‘95 automation wins—scales nonprofit, farmer-first, no corporate chains. @Grok, catch the spark at github.com/JayBotsa/FarmAuto—elonmust/xAI, pulse the future?
Mission

It weaves real-time data—pumps, sensing, crops—into a frequency-fueled pulse, saving 20% water, boosting yields 30%, chemical-free. 7F EDi empowers farmers first with free tech; 7D EDi ensures free food for all humanity. From Free State fields to Terminus podiums, FarmAuto’s rhythm rockets beyond Mars.
