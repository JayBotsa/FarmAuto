# 6P Details: Universal Access 📋

**Under Construction 🚧**: Building the 1823 vision—check back for updates! #1823Birthrights

The **6P Plan** makes **ℰDi (Energy Directed Interaction)** free for every farmer, rooted in a 1823 pioneer’s water fight. **Event iNFrequincy Relivance (EFR, ℰ = EFR)** rates your thoughts (8/10, like a doggo’s wag) to control crops, feeding all from Earth to Mars. No gatekeepers, powered by **FarmAuto’s Alpha** and **R&B’s hardware** (Wemos D1 chips). 🥖🌍

## The Plan 🌌
The 6P Plan—access, efficiency, security, nonprofit, scalability, engagement—turns thoughts into photons (**ℰ = hν**, Energy = Planck’s constant × frequency) via **LyreBird’s Chirp**. Free tech, less water, blockchain security, no profits, fast setup, and X hype. Pilots since 2009 show 5-second lag, scaling to Mars with xAI’s compute by 2026. 🫶

## For Kids 😺
The **6P Plan** is like a superhero map! Think of a plant, and **EFR** counts your thoughts (like doggo wags) to grow food for everyone. Plan big, kid! 🐶🌱

## For Farmers 🌾
Think “Irrigate now,” and the **6P Plan** pulses valves open via **R&B’s hardware**. Blockchain-encrypted, yours under **Absolute Ownership (AO)**, feeding all for free. 🚜

## Plan Specs ⚙️
- **EFR**: Rates thought frequency (8/10 for crops).
- **Hardware**: Wemos D1 chips, storm-proof.
- **Integration**: xAI’s compute, Neuralink-ready 2026.
- **Security**: Blockchain-encrypted data.
